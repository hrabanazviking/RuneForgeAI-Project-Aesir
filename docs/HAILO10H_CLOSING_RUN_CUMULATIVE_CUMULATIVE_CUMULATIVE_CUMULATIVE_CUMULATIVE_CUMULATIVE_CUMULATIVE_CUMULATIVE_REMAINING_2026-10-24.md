# The closing-run cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative-remaining remaining-count sequence, the distinct cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative totals, and the gap cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative cumulative-remaining remaining-count sequence (AES-NUM-263)

Slice 4.263, worked under `docs/TASK_CONTRACT_4.263.md`
(contract published in the 4.262 closing commit @
6c4d12ee). Host/artifact analysis only, on Mimir
(purpleviking1) — no physical child, no device run
of any kind. All findings below are taken from the
sha-verified raw output, read in full on-device
(section263.txt).

Crossing, stated exactly: arms263 was gzipped
with gzip -9 (sha256

(last 298 B), each part written as its own file
with its own sha256 gate — all seventeen verified
on-device on the first attempt; no byte accepted
unverified. The assembled gzip, arms and hef263
shas == VM on-device; hef263 assembled on-device
from hef262.py + arms263.py, sha == VM, py_compile OK.

LAUNCH: pre-launch tmux/ps check found no
hef263/h263 child; exactly ONE bounded host-side

2026-10-31 07:03:55 EDT) with the contract corpus
argv (glob order, MiniLM last), unbuffered
(`python3 -u`), and finished with exit marker 0

prefix against hef262.out: the first 59,196 lines
differ from hef262.out in exactly TWO lines

Definitions: POSITION is 1-based over the eight
acts of a closing run (position 1 = first act).
The A closing run is ranks 741–748 in A-offset
order; the B closing run is ranks 743–750 in
B-offset order. At each act position, the
AGREEMENT SET is the list, in the canonical family
order SIZE, CHANNEL, CLASS, RUN-102, OFFSET,
INDEX, of the families whose A value equals the
B value at that same position. The AGREEMENT
COUNT at a position is the number of families in
that position's agreement set (AES-NUM-248). The
CUMULATIVE AGREEMENT COUNT after a position is
the running total of the agreement counts over
positions 1 up to and including that position
(AES-NUM-249), ending at the total 16. The
CUMULATIVE-MINUS-COUNT DIFFERENCE at a position
is that position's cumulative total minus its own
agreement count (AES-NUM-250) — the cumulative
total before that position is counted. The
REMAINING at a position is 16 minus that
position's cumulative total (AES-NUM-251), ending
at 0. The CUMULATIVE REMAINING after a position
is the running total of the remaining values over
positions 1 up to and including that position
(AES-NUM-254), ending at the final cumulative
remaining total 70. The CUMULATIVE-REMAINING
REMAINING at a position is 70 minus that
position's cumulative remaining total — the
cumulative remaining instances still uncounted
after that position (AES-NUM-256). The
CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE-REMAINING REMAINING after
a position is the running total of the
cumulative-remaining remaining values over
positions 1 up to and including that position
(AES-NUM-257), ending at 157. The CUMULATIVE
CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE-REMAINING REMAINING after
a position is the running total of the
cumulative cumulative-remaining remaining values
over positions 1 up to and including that
position (AES-NUM-258), ending at 1049. The
CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE
CUMULATIVE-REMAINING REMAINING after a position
is the running total of the cumulative cumulative
cumulative-remaining remaining values over
positions 1 up to and including that position
(AES-NUM-259), ending at 4164. The CUMULATIVE
CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE
CUMULATIVE-REMAINING REMAINING after a position
is the running total of the cumulative cumulative
cumulative cumulative-remaining remaining values
over positions 1 up to and including that
position (AES-NUM-260), ending at 12648. The

a position is the running total of the cumulative
cumulative cumulative cumulative

positions 1 up to and including that position,
ending at 32370 (AES-NUM-261). The
CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE

REMAINING after a position is the running total
of the cumulative cumulative cumulative

REMAINING after a position is the running total
of the cumulative cumulative cumulative

cumulative-remaining

The GAP at a gap
position 1–7 is the next act's offset minus this
act's offset; gap agreement means the A gap
equals the B gap at that position; the GAP
REMAINING at a gap position is the gap total 3
minus the gap cumulative agreement count after
that gap position (per AES-NUM-251); the GAP
CUMULATIVE REMAINING after a gap position is the
running total of the gap remaining values over gap
positions 1 up to and including that gap
position (per AES-NUM-254), ending at the final
gap cumulative remaining total 15; the GAP
CUMULATIVE-REMAINING REMAINING at a gap position
is 15 minus that position's gap cumulative
